				<p class="lead">Gender inequality is the social phenomenon in which men and women are not treated equally. 
					The treatment may arise from distinctions regarding biology, psychology, or cultural norms prevalent in the society.
					Some of these distinctions are empirically grounded, while others appear to be social constructs. 
					Studies show the different experiences of genders across many domains including education, life expectancy, 
					personality, interests, family life, careers, and political affiliation. Gender inequality is experienced 
					differently across different cultures and it also affects non-binary</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">Infant Life Expectancy</h5>
						<p class="card-text">In India and China, the two most populous nations in the world, there is significant data that shows a survival disadvantage for girls under five years of age. In China, girls have a seven percent higher infant mortality rate than boys, and in India, a study conducted in the first decade of the 2000s found that the risk of death between the ages of one and five was 75 percent higher for girls than for boys.</p>
					</div>
				</div>


				<div class="card">
					<img class="card-img-top" src="example2.jpg" alt="Card image cap">
					<div class="card-body">
						<h5 class="card-title">Education</h5>
						<p class="card-text">Less than 40 percent of countries offer girls and boys equal access to education and only 39 percent of countries have equal proportions of the sexes enrolled in secondary education. By achieving universal primary and secondary education attainability in the adult population, it could be possible to lift more than 420 million people out of poverty. This would have its greatest effect on women and girls who are the most likely to never have stepped foot inside a school.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			
				<div class="card">
					<img class="card-img-top" src="example5.jpg" alt="Card image cap">
					<div class="card-body">
						<h5 class="card-title">Poverty</h5>
						<p class="card-text">In India of the total 30 percent people who are below poverty line, 70 percent are women. Women’s poverty in India is directly related to the absence of economic opportunities and autonomy, lack of access to economic resources including credit , land ownership and inheritance, lack of access to education and support services and their minimal participation in the decision making process. The situation of women on economic front is no better and men still enjoy a larger share of the cake. Thus poverty stands at the root of gender discrimination in our patriarchal society and this economic dependence on the male counterpart is itself a cause of gender disparity.</p>

				<div class="card">
					<img class="card-img-top" src="example4.jpg" alt="Card image cap">
					<div class="card-body">
						<h5 class="card-title">Illiteracy</h5>
						<p class="card-text">There are approximately 774 million illiterate adults in the world and two-thirds of them are women. There are approximately 123 million illiterate youths and 61 percent of them are girls. Women’s share in the illiterate population has not budged in 20 years. These facts not only affect women but their children as well. A child born to a mother with the ability to read is 50 percent more likely to survive past age five.</p>

This is stalled progress and a reversion to the deep gender equalities that characterized previous eras. To address this gap, our efforts cannot be done in silos, but must involve the people (girls in this case).</div><div class="col-md-6"><img src="reduce10.png" width="100%" height="100%"></div></div></div>

					<div class="tab-pane fade" id="list-point12" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="list-point12-list">One of the realities that we need to remember and address is that, when women “trespass” in spaces that were previously completely male-dominated there is often a penalty. In education and in the workplace that backlash often takes the form of sexual harassment, humiliation, violence.</div>
